# Predicting Diabetes Using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
This activity focuses on applying basic machine learning concepts to a real-world dataset by building a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict diabetes outcomes. The task involves loading and preprocessing the dataset, preparing training and testing splits, standardizing numerical features, constructing the ANN model using TensorFlow/Keras, and evaluating its performance using classification metrics.

The dataset used contains medical diagnostic features such as glucose concentration, BMI, insulin levels, age, and number of pregnancies, along with a binary outcome variable indicating whether the subject is diabetic (1) or non-diabetic (0). Through this activity, students get hands-on exposure to supervised learning and how neural networks can support decision-making in healthcare-related prediction tasks.
